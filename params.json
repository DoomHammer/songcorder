  "body": "### Songcorder\r\nIf you want to save your analogue collection as files and own a Linn DSM, you are in a right place. It doesn't matter if it is Sondek LP12, Nakamichi Dragon or maybe reel-to-reel Nagra you want to archive -- as long as you have it connected to a Linn DSM (or DS-I) you are ready to go.\r\n\r\nSongcorder records Songcast stream that Linn DSM uses for multi-room synchronization. In case of Linn Majik DS-I the streams are 96kHz/24bit. Things may be different with Exakt devices.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nMake sure you are using wired Ethernet connection between your Linn DSM and the machine you want to run Songcorder on. Wi-Fi might work, but may result in poorer quality due to missing packets. Consider yourself warned.\r\n\r\n[Download Songcorder](#Downloads) and unpack the archive. Meanwhile, select an input on your Linn DSM that you wish to record from. Run `songcorder` and wait for the questions. First, you need to select the network interface your Linn DSM can be reached at. Hopefully, you will only see one interface so pressing `1` should suffice. Wait for a moment until Songcorder finds Linn devices on the network. Next, you need to select a DSM device you want to record from. Again, if you only have one such device, press `1`. After 3 seconds recording should start. Spin the vinyl, press play or start singing to the Mic. Songcorder will save it to your disk.\r\n\r\nTo stop recording press `q`. Wait for some time for Songcorder to convert the raw stream to a WAV file. You should find it in the same directory named (unsurprisingly) `audio.wav`.\r\n\r\n*Warning*: depending on source quality recording is limited to a maximum of 2-4h. Longer recordings are currently unsupported.\r\n\r\n### Downloads\r\nCurrently only a very early proof of concept for MS Windows is available ([here it is](https://bintray.com/doomhammer/generic/download_file?file_path=songcorder-1.zip)).\r\n\r\nWatch this space.\r\n\r\n### Bugs, feature requests, comments\r\nRight now, this project is not even alpha quality. It should not scare your cat or raid your fridge, but I cannot guarantee any of it. Run it at your own risk and [let me know](https://github.com/DoomHammer/songcorder/issues) if it misbehaves. I will have a talk with it then...\r\n\r\nYou can use [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/DoomHammer/songcorder/issues) to file any bugs, feature requests and so on. I will be very grateful for the feedback I receive.\r\n\r\n### Shoulders of the Giants\r\nThis project makes use of available Open Source technology, mainly from [OpenHome](https://github.com/openhome) and [SoX](http://sox.sourceforge.net/).\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\nJust me, for now, [DoomHammer](mailto:DoomHammerNG+Songcorder@gmail.com).\r\n\r\n### Tips welcome\r\nLike the app?
